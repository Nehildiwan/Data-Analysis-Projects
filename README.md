This project involved a comprehensive analysis of a company's HR dataset spanning from 2000 to 2020, comprising over 22,000 employee records. The primary objective was to gain insights into employee demographics, departmental distributions, tenure patterns, and turnover rates. Key findings included gender and racial/ethnic disparities across departments, age distribution trends, and variations in turnover rates among different teams. Recommendations were provided regarding diversity and inclusion initiatives, employee retention strategies, workforce planning, remote work policies, and location-based initiatives. The analysis aimed to support data-driven decision-making processes related to workforce management and organizational development.
